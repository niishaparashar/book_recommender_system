# Book Recommendation System
Book Recommendation System DocumentationThis repository houses a comprehensive book recommendation system leveraging collaborative filtering techniques. The system is deployed as a web application using the Flask framework, providing both a display of popular titles and personalized book suggestions based on user input. The application interface adopts a modern, minimalistic, cyberpunk aesthetic, prioritizing high contrast and a technological look for clarity and engagement.I. Project Structure and Data AssetsThe project is structured to separate application logic, web templates, and persistent data files necessary for model operation.File/DirectoryPurposeDescriptionapp.pyCore Application LogicContains the Flask application routes (/, /recommend), the recommendation algorithm wrapper, and data loading mechanisms.requirements.txtDependency ManifestLists all required Python packages (e.g., Flask, gunicorn, numpy, pandas, scikit-learn) for environment setup.ProcfileDeployment CommandSpecifies the command (web: gunicorn app:app) used by the deployment server (Render/Heroku) to initiate the application.templates/Web Interface TemplatesHouses the Jinja2 HTML files (index.html, recommend.html) responsible for rendering the frontend, incorporating the Cyberpunk design scheme.static/Static AssetsContains the style.css file, which implements the visual aesthetics, including dark backgrounds, high contrast typography, and neon accents.*.pkl filesModel ArtifactsBinary files (popular.pkl, pt.pkl, similarity_scores.pkl, books.pkl) containing the pre-processed data structures (pivot table, similarity matrix, and condensed book details) necessary for real-time recommendation generation.II. Installation and Local SetupTo run this application locally, ensure you have Python 3.x installed and follow these steps:Clone the Repository:Bashgit clone https://github.com/niishaparashar/book_recommender_system
cd book_recommender_system
Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):Bashpython -m venv venv
# On Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
Install Dependencies:Bashpip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Application:Bashpython app.py
The application will be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:5000/.III. Recommendation MethodologyThe core of the system is based on a user-item collaborative filtering approach, implemented using cosine similarity.1. Data Processing and FilteringThe raw dataset undergoes filtering to improve model performance and efficiency:User Filtering: Only users who have rated a significant number of books (typically $\ge 200$) are retained, ensuring contributions are from active readers.Book Filtering: Only books that have received a minimum number of ratings (typically $\ge 50$) are considered, focusing on titles with sufficient user feedback.Pivot Table Generation: A sparse utility matrix (pt) is created, mapping filtered Book Titles (rows) to filtered User IDs (columns), with cell values representing the Book Rating. Missing ratings are imputed with a value of 0.2. Similarity ComputationCosine Similarity: The similarity between every pair of books is calculated by treating each book's rating vector (its row in the pivot table) as a multi-dimensional coordinate.The Cosine Similarity Score measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors, where a score closer to 1 indicates higher similarity (meaning users who liked one book also tended to like the other). The resulting data is stored in the similarity_scores matrix.3. Recommendation Generation (API Endpoint: /recommend_books)Upon receiving a target book_name from the user:The system identifies the index of the target book in the pivot table.It retrieves the corresponding similarity vector from the similarity_scores matrix.The vector is sorted to find the four most similar titles (excluding the target book itself).The titles, authors, and image URLs for these highly correlated books are returned to the user interface.IV. Web Application InterfaceThe Flask application exposes two primary views:Popular Books (/): Displays the top 50 books globally, ranked by a combination of high average rating and minimum number of ratings (as pre-calculated in popular.pkl). This view serves as the initial landing page and highlights universally appreciated titles.Recommendation Interface (/recommend): Provides an input field for users to search for recommendations based on a book of their choice. The results are displayed dynamically upon submission to the /recommend_books POST route
